# covid_dashboard

Another way for looking at the number of active, per-capita COVID-cases in Indiana. Graph is color-coded by pre-defined risk strata. Clone this repo then run the 'maps.py' file to generate an offline 'index.html' file in your broswer. Then you can slide the date, and track changes in infections. 'maps.py' pulls from CKAN Data's API to get the most recent information on the state of Indiana. 

Also, Purdue should stay online for F2020.
